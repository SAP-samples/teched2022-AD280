## Exercises

Provide the exercise content here directly in README.md using [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and linking to the specific exercise pages, below is an example.

- [Exercise 0 - Set up SAP Launchpad service in your trial account](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-portal-cloud-foundry-getting-started.html)
- Exercise 1 - Create your first launchpad site with a URL app
    - [Exercise 1.1 - Create your first site](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-portal-cloud-foundry-create-sitelaunchpad.html)
    - [Exercise 1.2 - Add an application to your site](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-portal-cloud-foundry-new-sapui5.html)


The next part of the SAP TechEd workshop is not an exercise for participants, but just a demo, as it requires an SAP S/4HANA system to be available to participants that is connected to the BTP trial subaccount using the SAP Cloud Connector and a destination in SAP BTP and configured for content federation. This goes beyond the scope of this workshop. Instead the content federation and consumption is shown as a demo.

Attendees who would like to run this exercise **after the TechEd workshop**, would need to have administrator access to an SAP S/4HANA 2020 system or higher available, e.g. using an [SAP S/4 HANA Fully Activated Appliance 30-day trial system](https://www.sap.com/products/erp/s4hana/trial.html) from the SAP Cloud Appliance Library. See this [Quick Start Guide](https://www.sap.com/documents/2019/04/4276422b-487d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html#page=1) for more information. Please follow the instructions in this [Enhance Your SAP Launchpad Site with Federated SAP S/4HANA Content tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/mission.launchpad-s4hana.html), but note that not all parts of this tutorial are part of the demo at the TechEd workshop.
