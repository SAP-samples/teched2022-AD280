In this tutorial you will create a site for a recruiting company called `JobCore`. You will then a add business app to this site.

## Prerequisites
You have subscribed to the SAP Launchpad service and assigned yourself to the `Launchpad_Admin` role.


### Step 1: Create a site

When you access the admin environment, the Site Directory is in focus. From here you will create your new site.

> In the side panel of the admin environment, you see four tools. The **Site Directory** where you are going to create a new site. All sites that you create will be displayed here. The **Content Manager** where you will manage cross-site content such as business apps. The **Channel Manager** where you manage different channels that expose business content that you can integrate into your sites. The fourth icon opens **Settings** where you can configure various settings related to SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition.


1. Click **Create Site**.
